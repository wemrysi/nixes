# NixOS 15.09 on a Dell XPS 13 (2015) laptop

Working configuration for LUKS + NixOS + XMonad and a fairly comprehensive xmobar.

As of August 2015, with the A05 BIOS most features of the laptop are working, including sound (I haven't tried bluetooth or the camera yet).

As of NixOS 15.09, microphone works and there are no video issues after resuming from suspend.

Installation was a bit of a chore, due to the broadcom wireless module, but thanks to Bernerd Schafer for his writeup of [installing NixOS on a MacBook air](https://robots.thoughtbot.com/install-linux-on-a-macbook-air) I was able to get everything installed.
